# Project Overview
The application leverages HTML forms for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and Redis as the database server.

This CRUD application consists of six microservices, covering key operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

I embraced Docker to harness its full potential for microservices architecture, utilizing Docker networks and local DNS for FQDN resolution.

Tech Stack: HTML forms, Python Flask, Redis.
